# Application-of-ML-in-EIU-s-forecasts
The project is executed in order to apply Machine Learning in EIU's forecasts in the annual country report. Linear regression and Regression tree are used for experimenting and Linear Regression proves to reduce both RMSE and MAE compared to EIU's current techniques.
The two techniques are experimented on datasets of three countries: US, Vietnam and Brazil, representing three different types of economies.
